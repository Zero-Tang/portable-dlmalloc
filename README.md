# portable-dlmalloc
Portable fork of Doug Lea's `malloc` implementation.

## Introduction
[This code is originally implemented by Doug Lea.](https://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html) The original source code is no longer available from [the FTP URL as listed in the site](ftp://g.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c), but you can still find it through [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190530015756/ftp://g.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c).

This repository serves as a fork so that `dlmalloc` can be ported to any platforms more easily.
